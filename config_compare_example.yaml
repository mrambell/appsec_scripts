# Production Promotion GO/NO-GO Assessment Configuration
# Mode: Compare (Comparative Assessment)
#
# This configuration compares certification environment against production
# to detect regressions and new vulnerabilities.

# Assessment mode: 'evaluate' or 'compare'
mode: compare

# Certification Environment Configuration
certification_environment:
  # Dynatrace tenant URL for certification environment
  url: "https://cert-tenant.live.dynatrace.com"
  
  # Dynatrace API token for certification environment
  # Required permissions:
  # - Read security problems (securityProblems.read)
  # - Read entities (entities.read)
  token: "dt0c01.CERT_TOKEN_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
  
  # SSL certificate verification (optional, default: true)
  verify_ssl: true
  
  # Scope mode: 'management_zone' or 'host_list'
  scope_mode: management_zone
  
  # Management zones for certification environment
  management_zones:
    - "Certification - Web Application"
    - "Certification - API Services"
    - "Certification - Database"
  
  # Alternative: Use host list instead of management zones
  # Uncomment to use host_list mode
  # scope_mode: host_list
  # hosts:
  #   - "HOST-CERT1234567890AB"
  #   - "HOST-CERTFEDCBA098765"

# Production Environment Configuration
production_environment:
  # Dynatrace tenant URL for production environment
  # Can be the same tenant as certification or different
  url: "https://prod-tenant.live.dynatrace.com"
  
  # Dynatrace API token for production environment
  # Required permissions:
  # - Read security problems (securityProblems.read)
  # - Read entities (entities.read)
  token: "dt0c01.PROD_TOKEN_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
  
  # SSL certificate verification (optional, default: true)
  verify_ssl: true
  
  # Scope mode: 'management_zone' or 'host_list'
  scope_mode: management_zone
  
  # Management zones for production environment
  # These should correspond to the same application in production
  management_zones:
    - "Production - Web Application"
    - "Production - API Services"
    - "Production - Database"
  
  # Alternative: Use host list instead of management zones
  # Uncomment to use host_list mode
  # scope_mode: host_list
  # hosts:
  #   - "HOST-PROD1234567890AB"
  #   - "HOST-PRODFEDCBA098765"

# Example: Mixed scope modes (certification uses MZ, production uses hosts)
# This is useful when environments are structured differently
#
# certification_environment:
#   scope_mode: management_zone
#   management_zones: ["Cert - App"]
#
# production_environment:
#   scope_mode: host_list
#   hosts: ["HOST-PROD123", "HOST-PROD456"]
