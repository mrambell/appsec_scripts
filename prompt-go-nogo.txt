Production Promotion GO - NO GO script

make a new script, taking in account dynatrace_api.py and vulnerabilities_by_host.py.
This script will evaluate the vulnerabilities found on a “Certification Environment”, either standalone using a “Evaluate mode” or comparing vulnerabilities found against a production environment using a “Compare mode”

It should have 
- A configuration file in YAML format accepting 
    - Mode: “Evaluate mode” or  “Compare mode”
    - Dynatrace Environment URLs
        - If on compare mode, differentiate between a “Certification environment” and “Production Environment”
    - Dynatrace Tokens for the authentication
        - If on compare mode, one token for each environment, under each environment yaml config
    - Mode: Management Zone list or Host List 
        - Mode Management Zone: expect management zone name list also in yaml format
            - If on compare mode, each environment should have its own Management Zone list, one for each environment 
    - Mode Host List:
        - A list or array of hosts in yaml format
            - If in compare mode, each environment should have its own hosts list, so one for each environment

    - Produce also an 2x example config files, one for Evaluate Mode and one for Compare Mode
- Depending on the mode, a logic to check vulnerabilities implementing this decision tree
    - In any case, for the certification environment
        - Check open vulnerabilities
            - Prepare a digest of the vulnerabilities, where vulnerability name is colored in red and Davis Security Score colored in Orange, within the bash script.
        - Go decision result
            - If the searched hosts or management zones have NO critical or high vulnerabilities
            - AND If NO vulnerability, regardless of the criticality, has with certainty NO vulnerable function in use
            - Produce a summary of the decision and why it was taken.
            - Add also a flag to only produce a meaningful machine readable GO result to pass as value to some other software or for a pipeline.
        - No GO decision result 
            - If elements checked have ANY critical OR high vulnerabilities
            - OR If ANY vulnerability regardless of criticality has ANY vulnerable function in use or if Vulnerable function in use cannot be assessed. 
            - Add also a flag to only produce a meaningful machine readable NO-GO result to pass as value to some other software or for a pipeline. Use also an Exit Flag in this case. This uses the same flag as for the GO result, it should be a generic flag.
        - Then prepare a report, text form, with all vulnerabilities found
            - Each vulnerability should present its associate processes and hosts as separate fields
            - All available metadata for vulnerability, hosts and processes
            - Default to JSON but add a flag to be able to change this to CSV format.
    - In case the user chooses “Compare mode”
        - Perform all the logic of Evaluate mode, BUT hold the Go and No Go decision logic
        - The fetch vulnerabilities of the Production Environment, also using the Dynatrace API and check
            - No new vulnerabilities introduced compared to Production
        - Think if there are other comparative checks you can run. If you find meaningful checks suggest them for my acceptance to add to this list.
        - Adjust Go and No Go decisions
        - GO decision result
            - If the comparative assessment with Production is positive and there is no regression AND
            - For certification
                - If the searched hosts or management zones have NO critical or high vulnerabilities 
                - AND If NO vulnerability, regardless of the criticality, has with certainty NO vulnerable function in use
                - Produce a summary of the decision and why it was taken.
        - No GO decision result 
            - If regression is introduced compared to production OR
            - For certification
                - If elements checked have ANY critical OR high vulnerabilities
                - OR If ANY vulnerability regardless of criticality has ANY vulnerable function in use or if Vulnerable function in use cannot be assessed. 

Add an option to activate in depth logging at each step.
Produce meaningful usage guide and documentation. The usage guide should be available also at the help command line switch or -h
